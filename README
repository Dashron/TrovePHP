Examples:

// Auth.php
$trove = new Trove($consmerKey, $consumerSecret);
$authUrl = $trove->buildAuthUrl();
// This does not have to be in the session, but it does require a level of persistence. It will be used on the page where you accept the token
$_SESSION['secret'] = $trove->tokenSecret();


// Accept.php
$trove = new Trove($consmerKey, $consumerSecret);
if($trove->acceptToken($_SESSION['secret'])) {
	// These would be saved in the database, tied to the user currently attempting authentication
	$_SESSION['token'] = $trove->token();
	$_SESSION['secret'] = $trove->tokenSecret();
}

// ViewUser.php
$trove = new Trove($consmerKey, $consumerSecret, $_SESSION['token'], $_SESSION['token_secret']);
// Note: trove requires a trailing slash on these requests. In the future I want to have it auto detected, and appended if forgotten
// Because when missed, you get a confusing 301 redirect which I currently do not tell curl to follow
$user = json_decode($trove->get('user/'), true);
